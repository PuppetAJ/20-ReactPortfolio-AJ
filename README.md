## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 20 react portfolio challenge submission. 

This project is a simple one page portfolio using react, and other knowledge we've learned throughout the coding bootcamp courses to improve upon the original module 2 portfolio. Overall I see a major improvement in quality and spent alot of time ensuring that the page was responsive and that the animations functioned as intended.
